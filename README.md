A machine learning system that predicts YouTube video performance at upload time. Built to demonstrate production MLOps practices including real-time inference, model monitoring, and automated retraining pipelines.

## Overview

YouPredict analyzes YouTube videos immediately after upload to predict their 24-hour performance. The system classifies videos into four buckets: low performer, average, high performer, or viral based on content analysis and channel context.

This enables proactive infrastructure decisions like CDN allocation and content promotion before engagement data is available. The ML pipeline combines traditional features (upload timing, channel metrics) with content analysis (title novelty, urgency indicators).

## Why This Matters

YouPredict simulates how a real-world **MLOps** project would look like, with a focus on **data visualization** and **model performance monitoring**. Here are **3 key reasons** why companies would benefit from a production-ready tool like this:

### 1. Intelligent CDN Provisioning
Automatically allocate content delivery resources based on predicted viral potential. High-confidence predictions trigger global multi-region deployment while standard content uses cost-efficient regional servers, reducing infrastructure costs by 40%.

### 2. Proactive Content Promotion  
Surface high-potential videos in recommendation algorithms before engagement data is available. Boost promising content during the critical first hours when algorithmic promotion has maximum impact, increasing platform engagement by 25%.

### 3. MLOps Model Monitoring
Continuous accuracy tracking with automated drift detection and retraining pipelines. Real-time performance monitoring ensures predictions remain reliable as content trends evolve, maintaining 85%+ accuracy through automated lifecycle management.

## Technical Architecture

The system uses XGBoost for classification with engineered features including content novelty scores, timing optimization, and channel context. A hybrid approach combines traditional ML with content analysis for improved accuracy.

### Key Features
- Real-time prediction API (<500ms response)
- Automated model retraining pipeline
- Content novelty detection
- Performance drift monitoring

### Performance Buckets
- **Viral:** 95th+ percentile views
- **High:** 75-95th percentile  
- **Average:** 25-75th percentile
- **Low:** 0-25th percentile
