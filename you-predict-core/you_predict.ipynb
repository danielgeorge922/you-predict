They then prepare and find a way to defeat Vecna on his turf. The military group who\\u2019s been pursuing El for her blood also show up to the final battle and have a face off with our main good guy gang. We see some of the military using the psychic disruption sonar & they got our gang on the ropes cornered in defense mode. And then Will gets shot in his left shoulder which pisses him tf off, Will\\u2019s flashbacks then overflow with momentum giving him immense strength while the epic music is playing and he summons & controls an entire army of monsters to take them down in which the military gets decimated & torn apart. And then Will lifts thi entire army of monsters up, break all limbs, and then break all their necks. \\nAfterwards, our gang says.. it\\u2019s time for the final battle.

Next scene, everyone besides Will & El, surround the mind flayer and atks the legs & eyes from all angles of the battlefield with fire & guns, & then we see Steve driving a military truck, while Dustin aim\\u2019s the psychic sonar disrupter towards Vecna who was on top of the mind flayers forehead, & then Harbour snipes Vecna\\u2019s legs & vecna falls to the ground, & then El uses her abilities to lift the mind flayer hundreds of feet into thi air, while Will controls the mindflayer breaking it\\u2019s limbs & then he screams ahhhhhh!!! Maximum aura as he forces it to stab itself in the head with all its legs. And then El screams as well, ahhhhhh!!! putting the nail in the coffin, slamming the defeated mind flayer down crashing onto Vecna killing him. \\nAt thi end, our main gang moves to a place far far away with 3 waterfalls, have Jonathan\\u2019s funeral, & then they all repeat their senior year at a new school and then graduate and then all pursue their passions within this city so it\\u2019s always convenient to see each other. \\nIf you read all this, thank you. \\ud83d\\ude42\\u200d\\u2195\\ufe0f\",\n",

I believe that little scene on the roof was them pretending to acknowledge that life will move on individually but it would be nice to say that we will all meet up once a week and hang out. Everybody that graduates or whatever together makes plans like that, but unfortunately it very rarely works out. They all have their own very different futures ahead of them, doing completely separate things. I think they know this, and by saying how they will all meet up once a week is just them doing some wishful hoping, yet they do know that it will never work, and chances are this may be the last time they are all together again, for a very long time at least! But we all know that as long as none of the main cast passes away in real life, or does something stupid and gets throws away their career, then 10-15 years down the line*(Hopefully that long if people are patient enough), they will bring the original group back together, a long with the big reveal of El, with a child of her own that has hints of her powers as well. Maybe that's what the whole story will be about, the Mindflayer coming back through Elevens child, since she still has the Mindflayer's evil black smoke in her. But either way, I am hesitant to look towards what they come out with next, with getting so invested in these kids and this story, it will be hard to not compare whatever the new characters will be like, to the original ones from this run. I am glad they got rid of that Argyle dude, it was becoming way too Scooby Doo with him...not like that wasn't basically the point of the whole show, but still, that dude bugged me and took away any actual fear or concern about anything being a Legit threat in that season. I know that not everything is supposed to be serious and scary, but it almost seemed like he was too out there and didn't bring anything to the table aside from transportation, Weed and Pizza*(Don't get me wrong, I dig all of those things!), but they were not needed in a story that already had so many working parts and a storyline that is meant to invest in the characters.

It was always only about friendship and the power of acceptance. The finale captures all of that essence. The duffers really cooked well with the epilogue. The last 45mins..right when robin started in WSQK to the final shot of Holly and co playing DnD,was insanely heartwarming. And i love what they did with el's ending.

Like several twists that all felt like one last twist, with stakes extra high, main character’s dying or limbs blown off, massive war with all demogorgans amongst other creatures & seeing Will & El going absolute calvary. \\nImagine two wars, the first war along with the supposed ending that we got,  was all an illusion created by Vecna, the second war starts when Max helps everyone out of thi illusion back to the real world back to their bodies, the scene would show everyone’s tether to the real world, different songs playing or someone or something that is everything to them as they all exit to a portal. They then prepare and find a way to defeat Vecna on his turf. The military group who’s been pursuing El for her blood also show up to the final battle and have a face off with our main good guy gang. We see some of the military using the psychic disruption sonar & they got our gang on the ropes cornered in defense mode. And then Will gets shot in his left shoulder which pisses him tf off, Will’s flashbacks then overflow with momentum giving him immense strength while the epic music is playing and he summons & controls an entire army of monsters to take them down in which the military gets decimated & torn apart. And then Will lifts thi entire army of monsters up, break all limbs, and then break all their necks. \\nAfterwards, our gang says.. it’s time for the final battle. They then come to the lair and meet the 2 main villains and before thi action starts, Will psychicly talks to Vecna and gives an epic speech/talk no jutsu, and says something along the lines of, people are so much more than what you believe they are, & proceeds to show him every single beautiful memory and then reaches deep into Vecna’s mind and pulls Henry out. And makes him realize he doesn’t need the mind flayer, & there’s so much more to life 🌈 etc. lol & just when everything is nice & dandy, the mind flayers tentacle’s engulf Henry’s entire body like a symbiote, & as Henry screams, as he transforms back into Vecna & he says, you’re too late…he belongs to me!!! And shoots a tentacle straight at Will, and black out……. we then see Jonathan has sacrificed himself for his little brother & we all experience the gut wrenching scene in slow motion cutting to everyone’s shocked faces, which turns into sadness, which then turns into immense rage. Next scene, everyone besides Will & El, surround the mind flayer and atks the legs & eyes from all angles of the battlefield with fire & guns, & then we see Steve driving a military truck, while Dustin aim’s the psychic sonar disrupter towards Vecna who was on top of the mind flayers forehead, & then Harbour snipes Vecna’s legs & vecna falls to the ground, & then El uses her abilities to lift the mind flayer hundreds of feet into thi air, while Will controls the mindflayer breaking it’s limbs & then he screams ahhhhhh!!! Maximum aura as he forces it to stab itself in the head with all its legs. And then El screams as well, ahhhhhh!!! putting the nail in the coffin, slamming the defeated mind flayer down crashing onto Vecna killing him. \\nAt thi end, our main gang moves to a place far far away with 3 waterfalls, have Jonathan’s funeral, & then they all repeat their senior year at a new school and then graduate and then all pursue their passions within this city so it’s always convenient to see each other. \\nIf you read all this, thank you. 🙂\\u200d↕️',\n",

I believe that little scene on the roof was them pretending to acknowledge that life will move on individually but it would be nice to say that we will all meet up once a week and hang out. Everybody that graduates or whatever together makes plans like that, but unfortunately it very rarely works out. They all have their own very different futures ahead of them, doing completely separate things. I think they know this, and by saying how they will all meet up once a week is just them doing some wishful hoping, yet they do know that it will never work, and chances are this may be the last time they are all together again, for a very long time at least! But we all know that as long as none of the main cast passes away in real life, or does something stupid and gets throws away their career, then 10-15 years down the line*(Hopefully that long if people are patient enough), they will bring the original group back together, a long with the big reveal of El, with a child of her own that has hints of her powers as well. Maybe that's what the whole story will be about, the Mindflayer coming back through Elevens child, since she still has the Mindflayer's evil black smoke in her. But either way, I am hesitant to look towards what they come out with next, with getting so invested in these kids and this story, it will be hard to not compare whatever the new characters will be like, to the original ones from this run. I am glad they got rid of that Argyle dude, it was becoming way too Scooby Doo with him...not like that wasn't basically the point of the whole show, but still, that dude bugged me and took away any actual fear or concern about anything being a Legit threat in that season. I know that not everything is supposed to be serious and scary, but it almost seemed like he was too out there and didn't bring anything to the table aside from transportation, Weed and Pizza*(Don't get me wrong, I dig all of those things!), but they were not needed in a story that already had so many working parts and a storyline that is meant to invest in the characters.
